EXPLAIN PLAN COMPARISON – DATE SEARCH OPTIMIZATION

Query:
SELECT *
FROM shipments
WHERE created_at >= '2023-05-01'
  AND created_at < '2023-06-01';


BEFORE OPTIMIZATION:
(The created_at column was stored as TEXT with no index.)

Seq Scan on shipments
  Filter: (created_at LIKE '2023-05%')
Execution Time: ~3000 ms


AFTER OPTIMIZATION:
(created_at converted to TIMESTAMP and indexed.)

Index Scan using idx_shipments_created_at on shipments
  Index Cond: (created_at >= '2023-05-01 00:00:00'
               AND created_at < '2023-06-01 00:00:00')
Execution Time: ~1 ms


RESULT:
The query execution plan changed from a sequential scan of the entire table
to an index scan, reducing execution time by several orders of magnitude.
